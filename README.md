## Motivation

Discovered Knodes at the 2012 TechCrunch Hackathon, won the API prize for the YourQ project.  After changing the name to Que.io, we discovered that we needed a better client library, so I built it.  Gained inspiration from the client libraries for Podio and Instagram.

## Tests

The tests rely on sample data from your social networks.
Sign up for an account here:
https://api.knod.es/portal/signup

Then, use the test harness to get your customer data. From there you can use this client to get the rest of the sample data.  
Put your sample data into .env (sample file provided)  
Then, to run the tests, you can use Guard for autotesting, or just vanilla Rspec:

```bundle exec guard```
